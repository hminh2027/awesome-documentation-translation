This repo exists for my personal learning purpose which contains documentation translated by me (therefore translation qualification should not be considered lol)

Some explanations for those categories:
- **Cloud**: learn fundamentals of cloud concept and cloud service/provider (Azure in this case)
- **Algo/DS**: things about algorithms and data structures, doing some exercises and finding different ways to tickle them
- **Framework**: instructions or guidelines for you to do something (interview in this case)
- **Data**: relate to some procedures when processing the data before and after (closed)
- **Mindset**: focus more on the mindset when approaching anything related to technology and career (which should be on top of the list IMO)
- **System**: deep dive into diverse types of systems and familiarize with the core concepts when designing a large system
