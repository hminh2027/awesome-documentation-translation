This repo exists for my personal learning purpose which contains documentation translated by me (therefore translation qualification should not be considered lol)

Some explanation for those categories:
- Cloud: learn fundamentals of cloud concept and cloud service/provider (Azure in this case)
- Algo/DS: things about algorithms and data structures, doing some exercises and finding different ways to tickle them
- Framework: instruction or guideline for you to do something (interview in this case)
- Data: relate to some procedures when processing the data before and after (closed)
- Mindset: focus more about the mindset when approach anything related to technology and career (which should be on top of the list IMO)
- System: deep dive into diverse types of systems and familiarize with the core concepts when designing a large system
